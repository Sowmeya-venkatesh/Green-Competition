## Introduction

Green Competition is an application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It serves as a platform where users can interact, share, post, and like images and content. However, it goes beyond being just a social platform; its primary mission is to create awareness about carbon footprints and the small steps people can take to make the world a better and greener place.

## Key Features

- **Content Liking**: The platform allows users to appreciate and support eco-friendly initiatives by liking and promoting relevant content.

- **Awareness Building**: Green Competition's core objective is to raise awareness about carbon footprints and inspire positive actions for a greener world.

## How It Works

1. **User Registration**: Users can create accounts and log in to the platform.

2. **Content Sharing**: Users can post images and content related to eco-conscious actions and ideas.

3. **Engagement**: Other users can interact with the shared content by liking and commenting on it.

## Conclusion
